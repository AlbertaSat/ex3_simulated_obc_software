### Branch naming conventions: 
The following branch naming conventions must be followed. Any PR not in compliance will be denied. The naming convention going is as follows:

<name_of_author>/<branch_type>/<description_of_branch>

The following is a list of possible branch types:   
- feature
- testing
- bugfix
- hotfix
- documentation

### Branching etiquette
- Branches must implement/change only a single feature.Changes related to that feature across different layers of code is acceptable.
- You may create branches off branches, but they will be merged in the order they were created. You also need to be prepared to accept the risk of having to rebase to a new parent branch parent branch, should those changes be declined.
- If you discover a bug unrelated to the feature you are working on, switch back to master, make a branch to fix the feature, then make a PR to merge that Bugfix. Chances are you aren't the only one experiencing the bug. You may rebase your development branch off the Bugfix branch.
- Branches that do not describe what they are changing will not be accepted.
